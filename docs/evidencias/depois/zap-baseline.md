## Alert Detail



### [ Authentication Request Identified ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10111/)



##### Informational (High)

### Description

The given request has been identified as an authentication request. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of key=value lines which identify any relevant fields. If the request is in a context which has an Authentication Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the authentication to match the request identified.

* URL: http://localhost:5002/login
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:5002/login ()(csrf_token,password,username)`
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `username`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `password`
  * Other Info: `userParam=username
userValue=ZAP
passwordParam=password
referer=http://localhost:5002/login
csrfToken=csrf_token`


Instances: 1

### Solution

This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Base64 Disclosure ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10094/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

Base64 encoded data was disclosed by the application/web server. Note: in the interests of performance not all base64 strings in the response were analyzed individually, the entire response should be looked at by the analyst/security team/developer(s).

  * Node Name: `http://localhost:5002`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``

  * Other Info: `���&ouYp��0ӿ��U�why�;zRO@Li[`


Instances: 3

### Solution

Manually confirm that the Base64 data does not leak sensitive information, and that the data cannot be aggregated/used to exploit other vulnerabilities.

#### WASC Id: 13

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Non-Storable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are not storable by caching components such as proxy servers. If the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information, it may benefit from being stored and cached, to improve performance.

* URL: http://localhost:5002
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:5002`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `302`
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 1

### Solution

The content may be marked as storable by ensuring that the following conditions are satisfied:
The request method must be understood by the cache and defined as being cacheable ("GET", "HEAD", and "POST" are currently defined as cacheable)
The response status code must be understood by the cache (one of the 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, or 5XX response classes are generally understood)
The "no-store" cache directive must not appear in the request or response header fields
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "private" response directive must not appear in the response
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "Authorization" header field must not appear in the request, unless the response explicitly allows it (using one of the "must-revalidate", "public", or "s-maxage" Cache-Control response directives)
In addition to the conditions above, at least one of the following conditions must also be satisfied by the response:
It must contain an "Expires" header field
It must contain a "max-age" response directive
For "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, it must contain a "s-maxage" response directive
It must contain a "Cache Control Extension" that allows it to be cached
It must have a status code that is defined as cacheable by default (200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, 501).

### [ Storable and Cacheable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, and may be retrieved directly from the cache, rather than from the origin server by the caching servers, in response to similar requests from other users. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where "shared" caching servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.

* URL: http://localhost:5002
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:5002`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`
* URL: http://localhost:5002/login
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:5002/login`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`
* URL: http://localhost:5002/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:5002/robots.txt`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`
* URL: http://localhost:5002/sitemap.xml
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:5002/sitemap.xml`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`
* URL: http://localhost:5002/login
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:5002/login ()(csrf_token,password,username)`
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`


Instances: 5

### Solution

Validate that the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information. If it does, consider the use of the following HTTP response headers, to limit, or prevent the content being stored and retrieved from the cache by another user:
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
This configuration directs both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 compliant caching servers to not store the response, and to not retrieve the response (without validation) from the cache, in response to a similar request.

### [ User Controllable HTML Element Attribute (Potential XSS) ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10031/)



##### Informational (Low)

### Description

This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.

* URL: http://localhost:5002/login
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:5002/login ()(csrf_token,password,username)`
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `csrf_token`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `User-controlled HTML attribute values were found. Try injecting special characters to see if XSS might be possible. The page at the following URL:

http://localhost:5002/login

appears to include user input in:
a(n) [input] tag [value] attribute

The user input found was:
csrf_token=kPjwJm91WXC-gjDTv44W-lWud2h5khk7elJPQExpH1s

The user-controlled value was:
kpjwjm91wxc-gjdtv44w-lwud2h5khk7eljpqexph1s`


Instances: 1

### Solution

Validate all input and sanitize output it before writing to any HTML attributes.
